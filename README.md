# Karas Koin
This project implements a basic blockchain system tailored for managing fishing transactions. It serves as a decentralized ledger where fishing activities, including catches and transactions between anglers and fishery entities, are recorded securely and transparently. This blockchain solution is designed as a part of a university project to demonstrate the application of blockchain technology in managing fishing-related data.
